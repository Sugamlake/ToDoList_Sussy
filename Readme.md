### Technology used: 
- HTML5
- CSS3

### Features: 

1.- In this process, we use our own styles, more than anything making a darker background.

2.- Later we add a hover when the mouse is passed to highlight which everything is marked.

3.- An image of close was added, to indicate that by clicking that to do is eliminated.

4.- The Add Todo is also shaded when the mouse is hovered

In the future it could have :

- Other modifications 
- Could be adjusted to corporate colors
- It could deliver an alert when it reaches a predetermined cutoff point
- Can be adjusted to indicate quantities
